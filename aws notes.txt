what they can access: Authorization

Auth:

Authorization

email address: root account (admin power)


create a users
add permission to the user on the basis of req



IAM (Identity and Access Management) 
Identity: Authentication
Access: Authorization


Identity: 
User
Group
Roles


Access:
Policies/Permissions (ex: only access to ec2)
AWS managed
Customer managed

Best Practices:
LPP (Least priviledge permission)

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started-reduce-permissions.html

Teams in any org:
Dev
Test
Prod
Release

create groups and assign the permission based on role/responsibility


ec2: app would be deployed, will try to upload files to s3
roles: ec2 get access to s3

Note: Every api calls you make it in aws should be authenticated
